### Leveraging Cloud and Version Control Tools

Modern data teams work in the cloud and expect analysts to collaborate with tools like Git and GitHub. Including projects that use these platforms signals you’re up-to-date and ready to work in environments where scalability and teamwork matter.

Here’s how to show you’re cloud- and collaboration-ready:

- **Cloud platforms:** Host dashboards or notebooks on AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. Document how you moved data or built models using cloud storage, compute, or pipelines.
- **Version control:** Push your code and project documentation to GitHub or GitLab. Use branches for work-in-progress, and write clear README files.
- **Team collaboration:** If you worked with others, credit contributors and show how you managed tasks or merged code.
- **Project reproducibility:** Include instructions for running your code, installing dependencies, and replicating results.

Employers value candidates who can transition smoothly into existing workflows. Public GitHub repositories not only prove your skills but also allow them to review your code, reasoning, and documentation in one place.

### Standing Out with Storytelling and Business Impact

Even the best technical solutions fall flat if you can’t explain why they matter. Make every project tell a story. Shift your focus from what you did to why it was needed, how you approached it, and what business decisions or outcomes resulted.

To boost your business storytelling:

- **Clear problem statement:** Outline the business context, not just the data. What pain point or opportunity were you addressing?
- **Approach and reasoning:** Walk the reader through your critical choices. Why those methods? How did you iterate or improve along the way?
- **Actionable insights:** Share specific findings and recommendations. What changed as a result of your analysis? Did your work drive cost savings, higher sales, better user insights, or improved operational efficiency?
- **Visualization as communication:** Use simple charts that point to the takeaway, not just “pretty” visuals. Every chart should help the reader remember your main points.

By making your business impact obvious, you turn technical work into results that matter for an organization. Want to see what that looks like in practice?
